# Week 7: Fall Break

## Summary

There is not class meeting this week due to IUâ€™s fall break. I encourage you to make use of the break to relax and regroup. For the other time this week you would have spent on readings, discussion, and other class preparation, consider exploring more of the [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) documentation and working on your final project. Or you may want to explore some useful relevant LinkedIn Learning tutorials. Some possibilities include:
