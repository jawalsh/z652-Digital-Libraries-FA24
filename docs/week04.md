# Week 4: Metadata 1

## Summary
We will learn about what metadata is, different types of metadata, what it's used for, and why it's important. We will also learn about a few different major metadata application profiles (also known as schemas) commonly used in digital libraries. As we prep for writing out own metadata application profiles and building our CollectionBuilder sites more, we will also be practicing how to read and navigate documentation and how to write good documentation.

## Weekly Learning Objectives
- _define_ metadata
- _distinguish_ between types of metadata and metadata standards
- _identify_ relevant Dublin Core elements for a given item
- _Reflect_ on good vs. bad documentation
- _Learn_ to navigate documentation and troubleshoot
