# Week 13: CollectionBuilder: Final project lab

## Summary

This week we will work collaboratively to advance our final projects. Come prepared to put the finishing touches on your CollectionBuilder-based final projects. Try new configuration options, ask questions, and help your fellow students.

## Weekly Learning Objectives

The objective this week is to _implement_ all we have learned this semester to _build_ a compelling and professional digital collection.

## Before class: Readings, resources, and tasks

- Review [CollectionBuilder Documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/)
- Review [CollectionBuilder-GH Workshop Tutorial](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/workshop/gh/) _Be aware that some details have may have changed since the Workshop was developed in 2020._
	
There will be no discussion this week, but you should post questions or insights about your work with your CollectionBuilder site to our [Technical questions and  help](https://github.com/jawalsh/z652-Digital-Libraries/discussions/9) discussion. 
 
## In class



The rest of class time will be devoted to working on your final projects and enhancing your CollectionBuilder project with the configuration and page-building techniques that we are learning about this week.
